# My Portfolio Website!
I'm very excited to create this personal site, using everything I've learned with Innovate Birmingham! 

# What I'm Working on Adding: 
So far I have made several additions and improvements, and I am currently working on sprucing up the labs and projects we worked on during the coding bootcamp and adding them to the Projects section of my website. 

# What I'm Using: 
So far I've been using create-react-app, node, bootstrap, react-bootstrap (for a more customized, collapsable navbar), animista (for custom css animations), reacticons, and a custom sass file.
